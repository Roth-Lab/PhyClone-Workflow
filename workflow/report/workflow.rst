Given an `input file <https://github.com/Roth-Lab/pyclone-vi#input-format>`__, this workflow runs `PyClone-VI <https://github.com/Roth-Lab/pyclone-vi>`__ clustering followed by `PhyClone <https://github.com/Roth-Lab/PhyClone>`__ phylogenetic reconstruction, for multi-sample bulk-sequencing data.

The workflow consists of three major stages:
    1. Input data pre-processing, `Input Processing`_
    2. PyClone-VI Pre-clustering, `PyClone-VI`_
    3. PhyClone Phylogenetic Reconstruction, `PhyClone`_
